# Literature Sync: Zotero + Obsidian Pipeline

Takes the `.bib` output of `/search-lit` (or any user-specified .bib file) and
synchronizes the references into the Zotero library and Obsidian literature notes.
When enough literature notes accumulate, extracts cross-cutting concept notes.

## Communication Rules

- Communicate with the user in their preferred language (typically Korean).
- Note template headings (`서지 정보`, `핵심 내용`, `내 생각`, `관련 노트`), vault
  folder paths (`02 연구/문헌/`, `02 연구/개념노트/`), and Obsidian-side conventions
  are preserved as literal template content because they match the user's existing vault.

## When to Use

- After `/search-lit` completes — sync the produced .bib into Zotero + Obsidian.
- Bulk-register references from an existing .bib into Zotero + Obsidian.
- Tidy the `references/` folder inside a project workspace.
- On explicit concept-extraction request → extract cross-cutting concepts from existing literature notes.

## Prerequisites

- Zotero MCP server available (skip the Zotero phase if not connected).
- Obsidian CLI or direct file writing to the Obsidian vault.
- Obsidian vault path: configured in user's environment (e.g., `$OBSIDIAN_VAULT`).

## Pipeline Overview

```
.bib file (or /search-lit output)
    │
    ▼ Phase 1: Parse
    Extract DOI, PMID, title, authors, journal, year
    │
    ▼ Phase 2: Zotero Sync
    Dedupe check → zotero_add_by_doi → place in collection
    │
    ▼ Phase 3: Obsidian Literature Notes
    Create 02 연구/문헌/{citekey}.md (empty note OK — fill later with highlights)
    │
    ▼ Phase 4: Concept Extraction (conditional)
    ≥10 literature notes → scan for cross-cutting concepts → propose concept notes
```

## Phase 1: Parse BibTeX

### Input

The user-specified .bib file path, or the .bib just produced by `/search-lit`.

### Process

```python
# Parse .bib entries with regex.
# Extract per entry:
#   - citekey (e.g., Kim_2024_Validation)
#   - doi
#   - pmid
#   - title
#   - authors (first + last minimum)
#   - journal
#   - year
#   - volume, number, pages (if present)
```

Log any parse failures and skip those entries.

---

## Phase 2: Zotero Sync

### Step 2.1: Determine project collection

Identify the project from the current working directory or from an explicit user
override. Reuse an existing collection key if one is recorded; otherwise create a
new collection.

**Collection mapping**: Check existing Zotero collections for the current project.
If no collection exists, create one with `zotero_create_collection`. Record the
collection key for future use.

### Step 2.2: Dedupe + add

For each entry:

1. Use `zotero_search_items` to search by DOI or title — if already present, skip.
2. Otherwise call `zotero_add_by_doi` (when a DOI is available) or
   `zotero_add_by_url` (falling back to the PubMed URL when no DOI is available).
3. Use `zotero_manage_collections` to place the item in the project collection.

### Step 2.3: Result report

```
Zotero Sync:
  Added:     8 papers (new)
  Skipped:   3 papers (already in library)
  Failed:    1 paper (no DOI/PMID)
  Collection: RFA-Meta (TZQEP4NH)
```

If the Zotero MCP is not connected, skip this entire phase and proceed to Phase 3.

Always write `references/zotero_collection.json` in the project workspace:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "status": "synced",
  "collection": "RFA-Meta",
  "collection_key": "TZQEP4NH",
  "added": 8,
  "skipped": 3,
  "failed": 1
}
```

If Zotero is unavailable, write the same file with `status: "skipped"` and a
human-readable `reason`.

## Phase 3: Obsidian Literature Notes

### Step 3.1: Check existing literature notes

```bash
ls "$VAULT/02 연구/문헌/" | grep -v "📊" | wc -l
```

### Step 3.2: Create literature notes

For each .bib entry, create `02 연구/문헌/{citekey}.md`.
**Skip if the file already exists** (never overwrite).

#### Template

```markdown
---
notetype: literature
citekey: "{citekey}"
title: "{title}"
authors: "{authors}"
journal: "{journal}"
year: {year}
doi: "{doi}"
pmid: "{pmid}"
created: "{today}"
tags:
  - type/literature
  - _unread
---

# {title}

## 서지 정보
- **저자**: {authors}
- **저널**: {journal}{volume_issue_pages}
- **연도**: {year}
- **DOI**: [{doi}](https://doi.org/{doi})
{pmid_line}

## 핵심 내용 (내 언어로)



## 내 생각



## 관련 노트
- [[🗺️ 연구 종합]]
- [[🗺️ 논문과 리뷰]]
-
-
```

**Rules:**
- `notetype: literature` — compatible with the Zotero Integration template.
- `_unread` tag — change to `_read` later after the user reads the PDF in Zotero and adds highlights.
- Leave `## 핵심 내용` and `## 내 생각` blank — the user fills these in personally.
- `## 관련 노트` contains 2 hub links + 2 empty slots (reserved for later concept-note linking).
- If a PMID is available, add a PubMed link.

### Step 3.3: Result report

```
Obsidian Literature Notes:
  Created:   8 notes (new)
  Skipped:   3 notes (already exist)
  Location:  02 연구/문헌/
  Total in vault: 12 literature notes
```

---

## Phase 4: Concept Extraction (conditional)

### Trigger condition

Run this phase only when there are **≥10** literature notes in the vault.
If fewer exist, print a status message like "N literature notes — concept extraction
unlocks at ≥10" and stop.

### Step 4.1: Cross-cutting concept scan

Read all files under `02 연구/문헌/*.md`:
1. Extract keywords from each paper's title, journal, and tags.
2. Extract major concepts from the .bib entry titles.
3. Identify **concepts that co-occur across ≥3 literature notes**.

### Step 4.2: Filtering (5 exclusion rules)

Exclude from concept candidates:
- Model names (GPT-4, Claude, etc.).
- Dataset names (MedQA, ImageNet, etc.).
- Journal names.
- Institution names.
- Generic technique names (too unspecific).

Whatever remains becomes a concept-note candidate.

### Step 4.3: Draft concept note

Create `02 연구/개념노트/{concept name}.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "{concept name}"
type: concept
tags:
  - 🧠개념
  - {domain tag}
aliases:
  - {English/Korean alternative name}
related_papers:
  - "[[{lit-note-1}]]"
  - "[[{lit-note-2}]]"
  - "[[{lit-note-3}]]"
status: 🌱Seedling
---

# {concept name}

## 정의 (My Understanding)
> TODO: write in your own words

## 왜 중요한가
{why the concept matters in this domain — AI supplies a draft}

## 논문별 관점
- **[[{lit-note-1}]]**: {this paper's angle}
- **[[{lit-note-2}]]**: {a different angle}
- **[[{lit-note-3}]]**: {comparison / complement}

## 관련 개념
- [[{another concept}]]

## 열린 질문
- {open question 1}
- {open question 2}

## 관련 노트
- [[🗺️ 연구 종합]]
- [[{related project hub}]]
- [[{lit-note-1}]]
- [[{lit-note-2}]]
```

**Key rules:**
- Keep the `## 정의` section as a `> TODO` marker — the 2nd-layer note only becomes
  meaningful once the user writes the definition in their own words.
- `status` always starts at `🌱Seedling`.
- At least 4 wikilinks under `## 관련 노트` (vault convention).

### Step 4.4: Propose to the user

```
Concept-note candidates (≥3 papers cross-referenced):
  1. {Concept A} (4 papers)
  2. {Concept B} (3 papers)
  3. {Concept C} (5 papers)

Create? (all / selected / skip)
```

Create only after user confirmation. **Auto-draft but always confirm.**

---

## Standalone Modes

This skill can run without a fresh .bib file.

### Concept extraction only
On an explicit concept-extraction request, scan existing
`02 연구/문헌/*.md` and run only Phase 4.

### References tidy
On a "tidy this project's references" request, locate `.bib` files inside the
workspace and run Phase 1–3.

### Zotero sync only
On a "sync Zotero" request, diff the Zotero collection against the `.bib` file
and add whatever is missing.

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never overwrite literature notes** — the user may have added highlights or
   personal notes.
2. **Never auto-fill `## 정의` of a concept note** — keep the TODO marker; the
   essence of the 2nd-layer note is the user's own wording.
3. **Skip Zotero for entries without a DOI** — ask the user to add those manually.
4. **Gracefully skip Zotero when the MCP is not connected** — Obsidian notes are
   created independently.
5. **Always record the collection key** — report the key to the user when a new
   collection is created.

## Anti-Hallucination

- **Never fabricate DOIs, PMIDs, or citation metadata.** All bibliographic data must come from the .bib file or API responses.
- **Never auto-fill the "정의 (My Understanding)" section** of concept notes. This must be written by the user.
- **Never overwrite existing literature notes.** User highlights and annotations may be present.
- If a DOI lookup fails, report the failure rather than guessing the metadata.
